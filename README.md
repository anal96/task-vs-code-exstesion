**Tasks** is a lightweight, scalable, and highly productive task manager built directly inside Visual Studio Code. Stop context-switching to browser tabs or standalone apps. Keep your to-dos right next to your code.

## 🌟 Features

### 🚀 Advanced Task Management
* **Workspace & Global Contexts**: Maintain tasks specific to your current repository, or global tasks that follow you everywhere.
* **Categories**: Group your tasks flawlessly (e.g., *Inbox*, *Work*, *Study*).
* **Priorities**: Assign 🔥 High, 🔸 Medium, or 🧊 Low priority to structure your workflow.

### 🧠 Smart Developer Features
* **TODO Scanner**: Hover over `// TODO` or `// FIXME` comments in your code, press `Cmd + .` (or `Ctrl + .`) for Quick Fixes, and instantly import the comment into your Sidebar!
* **Jump To Code**: Tasks imported from code save the file path and line number. Click the task in the sidebar, and your editor instantly jumps back to the code!

### 🎨 Beautiful UI Integration
* Built natively atop the VS Code TreeView API for a seamless, fast experience.
* Visual completion progress bars for project categories.
* Minimalist status bar counter to keep you focused.

## 🛠️ Usage

1. Open the **Tasks** icon in the Activity Bar (Sidebar).
2. Click the `+` icon to add a new task.
3. Choose the Priority and Category.
4. Click the ✅ circle to mark as complete!

### Configuration Options
You can tweak the extension via VS Code Settings (`Cmd + ,` or `Ctrl + ,`):
* `tasks.defaultPriority`: Choose your default task priority (`low`, `medium`, `high`).
* `tasks.showCompleted`: Toggle visibility of completed tasks off/on.
* `tasks.autoDeleteCompleted`: If true, completing a task instantly deletes it.
